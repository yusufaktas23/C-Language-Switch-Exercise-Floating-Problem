# C-Language-Switch-Exercise-Floating-Problem
Hi everyone, I have learned switch statements and i need some help on this exercise.
Im working on programming exercise, in this one i had a problem with prompting char value from user.
When i promted data, code is taking "enter" from past prompts as value. This causes code to display the answer of "default case".
I find a way to prevent this by using "%*c" on scanf.
What i need to learn is "Can we prevent this by using another way?" Is there optional answer for this?
I'm using replit for writing code, here is the link https://replit.com/languages/c
